// SSOT for how long a service can be bought for.

// A recurring service is sold for a fixed term, and the backend requires that
// term to be a whole number of billing periods (serviceBillingSchedule.js
// refuses anything else). Letting the customer type a number meant they could
// enter one that cannot resolve into cycles and only learn on submit, so the
// valid terms are listed instead of typed.
//
// Both purchase surfaces — the in-project Add-a-Service modal and the standalone
// service page — read the cap and the option list from here, so the two can
// never offer different terms.
