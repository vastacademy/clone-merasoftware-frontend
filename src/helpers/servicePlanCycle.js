// IS ANOTHER CYCLE COMING? — one question, one answer, matching the server.
//
// A service plan's allowance comes back each billing cycle, so when a customer has spent it
// the screen has to say when it returns. That is only true if another cycle is actually
// coming, and three different kinds of service live in the data:
//
//   fixed tenure  — bought for N cycles (serviceTotalCycles). The allowance returns until
//                   the last one, then the plan is finished.
//   recurring     — billed on a date with no agreed end. The allowance keeps returning.
//   one-off       — sold on plain validity, no billing cycle at all. What was bought is
//                   all there is.
//
// PlanDetails.js used to assume the first two and print "More on <cycle end>" whatever the
// service was. On a one-off plan that promises a renewal that will never happen, and on a
// service with no cycle end recorded it prints "More on Invalid Date". Live data at the time
// of writing: 8 service orders — 2 fixed-tenure, 2 recurring, 4 with no next cycle at all.
//
// THE RULE IS THE SERVER'S, NOT A NEW ONE. cron/servicePlanRenewalCron.js decides exactly
// this when it runs:
//
//     find services with serviceNextBillingDate <= now
//     if isFixedTenureService(service) && isFinalCycle(service, currentCycleNumber)
//        -> mark expired, stop billing
//     else -> bill the next cycle
//
// (backend/helpers/serviceBillingSchedule.js holds isFixedTenureService / isFinalCycle.)
// This asks the same two things in the same order, so the page and the cron can never tell
// the customer two different stories. If that rule ever changes, it changes in one place and
// this comment says where to look.
